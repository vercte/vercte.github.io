            I am a web developer and a 3d modeler who loves to make stuff.
            I work on some projects for fun with other people, and I'm not really doing any paid projects right now
            (just open source and fun projects, you know, for fun)
            <br><br>
            Want to see the projects that I'm working on? <a href="#projects">There's a section for that</a>.

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            This is my website, so why not tell you more about me? That must be why you're here... right?
            As I just said, I'm a web developer. I mostly do frontend, making on-the-computer web apps and such,
            but I'm also trying out backend. If I can successfully make a web server, I might actually host my website on someplace other than Github Pages!
            <br><br>
            I also make games for fun, using <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> and <a href="https://roblox.com/create">Roblox Studio</a>. 
            I haven't created anything notable for now, but I'll update here (or the projects section) when I do.

            <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
            These aren't all my projects, <a href="projects">these are</a>. The projects here just my main goals right now. <br> Queue the beautiful display!
